As this thesis borders between computer science and qualitative research on consumer behaviour I would like PD Dr. Georg Groh of the Research Group for Social Computing for his input, support, good ideas and continuous feedback during the project and Hannah Danner from the Chair of Marketing and Consumer behavior. Without their collaboration this project and thesis would not be possible. 

Furthermore, I would like to thank Gerhard Hagerer for his support and good ideas during the project and continuous feedback and Jan Hauffa, for his input regarding Topic Modeling.

%Furthermore, I would like to thank the other team members of the SocialROM project Adnan Akhundov, Ahmed Ayad, Tim Berger, Rajat Jain, Tim Berger, Vishesh Mathur and Adrian Philipp for often tedious but every-time fruitful discussions every week.

As well i want to thank my parents Vaclava and Georg for their support during my Bachelor studies. Further, I would like to thank Christian Widmer for his support while working on this project and for proof-reading the thesis.
