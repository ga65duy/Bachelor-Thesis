Topic modeling is a popular approach to study large document collections. It returns topics as a set of coherent words, that are usually manually labeled, regarding the concept the top 10 words of a topic are describing.

Both approaches shall help the Domain experts using topic modeling for their work and understand which effect a higher or low number of topics has on the quality of the generated topics.
